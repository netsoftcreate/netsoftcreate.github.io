## Project Description

Network softwarization will revolutionize how network and computing infrastructures are designed and operated to deliver services and applications with greater agility and cost effectiveness. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are two expressions of network softwarization. SDN enables fast innovation by making the network programmable, and it leads to greater responsiveness, security, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. NFV replaces equipment, such as load balancers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and signaling systems, with software running on commodity hardware. The cost and complexity of operating the network is reduced dramatically by management software that operates on converged SDN and cloud infrastructure. Together SDN, NFV and Cloud are driving a transformation of networks. The NSERC Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) in Network Softwarization (NetSoft) is a partnership of academia and industry to meet the critical need to produce the HQP required to drive the coming wave of network innovation. NetSoft will deliver a multi-disciplinary program with five components:

- **Enhanced Graduate Curriculum**: NetSoft will enhance university course offerings with innovative courses and workshops on softwarization.
- **Practical Training in SDN and NFV**: Software skills in SDN and NFV through lab exercises and design projects using leading-edge research testbeds.
- **Research Experience**: Research activities under the supervision and mentorship of a NetSoft researcher.
- **Internships in Canadian Companies**: Practical and in-depth experience through industry internships on projects that help partners address SDN/NFV challenges.
- **Acquisition of Soft Skills**: A program of short courses to develop strategic thinking and soft skills for success in industry and business.
